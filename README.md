Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm, where the goal is for the model to learn a mapping from inputs (features) to outputs (target).
Building a linear regression model involves several key steps. Here's a structured approach: 
  1-1.	Define the Problem 
  2.	Prepare the Data 
     a.	Collect Data 
     b.	Clean the Data 
     c.	Encode Categorical Variables 
     d.	Scale/Normalize Features 
     e.	Split Data 
  3.	Explore the Data 
  4.	Build the Model 
      a.	Choose a Linear Regression Algorithm 
      b.	Fit the Model 
  5.	Evaluate the Model 
      a.	Test the Model 
      b.	Evaluate Metrics
